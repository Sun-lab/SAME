Title: Somatic mutation Association test with Measurement Errors
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Yang", "Liu", email = "yliu23@fredhutch.org", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Association analysis using somatic mutations. It accounts for somatic mutation calling uncertainty by modeling the true somatic mutation status as a latent variable and exploiting read count data to augment the mutation calls. Two versions of the test are provided, one for mutation-level analysis using a single somatic mutation (mSAME) and the other one for gene-level analysis using multiple mutations within a gene (gSAME).
